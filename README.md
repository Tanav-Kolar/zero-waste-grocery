# ü•£ Little Leftovers: Zero-Waste Grocery Helper

**A conversational AI assistant that helps you generate creative, zero-waste recipes using the ingredients you already have.**

Built using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), and [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) or [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) for a fast, scalable user experience.

## üöÄ Features

* ‚ôªÔ∏è **Zero-waste cooking assistant** that suggests recipes based on your available ingredients.
* üìö **Semantic recipe search** using Pinecone vectorstore with HuggingFace sentence embeddings.
* üí¨ **Conversational flow** powered by LangGraph state machines.
* üó£Ô∏è **Voice interaction** powered by OpenAI Whisper large model for hands-free cooking help.
* üîÅ **Follow-up interaction** to continue chatting about the recipe or ask for variations.
* ‚ö°Ô∏è **Fast and interactive UI** built with Streamlit.
* üß† **Enhanced knowledge base** using top 70 recipes from **Recipe1M+** dataset.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### Graph Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[Retrieve Ingredients]
    B --> C[Generate Recipe]
    C --> D[Follow-up Conversation]
    D -->|User continues| D
    D -->|User ends| E[End]
````

1. **Retrieve**: Search relevant recipes using Pinecone vectorstore populated with the top 70 Recipe1M+ entries.
2. **Generate**: Craft a creative zero-waste recipe using an LLM.
3. **Follow-up**: Continue conversation based on recipe context and chat history.
4. **Voice Input**: Users can now speak their ingredient list or follow-up questions using integrated Whisper voice-to-text.
